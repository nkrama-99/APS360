Our model will predict the missing features \n","based on the information that we do have about each person.\n","\n","We will use a variation of a denoising autoencoder to solve this data imputation\n","problem. Our autoencoder will be trained using inputs that have one categorical feature artificially\n","removed, and the goal of the autoencoder is to correctly reconstruct all features,\n","including the one removed from the input.\n","\n","In the process, you are expected to learn to:\n","\n","1.
